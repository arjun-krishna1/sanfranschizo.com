You are the mayor of San Franschizo. Best of luck sucka

Here's a plan to develop "Mayor of San Franschizo" using the guide from Peter Lunch's blog on how to plan and build a programming project:

Step 1: Define the Project
Project Definition:

    What is the Project? "Mayor of San Franschizo" is a satirical city management game where players govern a whimsical version of San Francisco, leveraging LLM technology for dynamic gameplay.
    MVP (Minimal Viable Product):
        Basic city management with a few core issues (Tech Bro Invasion, Homelessness Crisis).
        Simple LLM integration for policy outcomes and basic character interactions.
        A single district with limited buildings and upgrades.
    Nice to Haves:
        Multiple districts with unique challenges.
        Extensive LLM-generated events, stories, and social media interactions.
        Multiplayer or community events where players can impact each other's cities.
    When will the Project be Complete? Target completion for MVP in 3 months, with ongoing updates for additional features.


Step 2: Set Up Your Workflow
Tools Needed:

    Development Environment: Use Visual Studio Code for its versatility with JavaScript/Node.js or Python, depending on the game engine.
    Version Control: GitHub for tracking changes and collaboration.
    Project Management: Trello or Jira for managing tasks, with a Kanban board setup.


Workflow Setup:

    Create a Trello board with columns: To Do, Doing, Done.
    Cards for each feature or task, like "Implement LLM Policy Generation", "Design Character Interaction System".


Step 3: Break Down the Project
Components to Build:

    Game Engine: Decide between Unity, Godot, or a custom HTML5/JavaScript setup.
    LLM Integration: 
        API Connection: Use an API like xAI's for LLM capabilities.
        Policy Generator: Write a module where LLM suggests outcomes based on player input.
        Character Dialogue: Develop an interface where characters respond dynamically.


Tasks:

    Backend:
        Set up server to handle LLM requests.
        Create a database schema for game state, player choices, and dynamic content.
    Frontend:
        Design UI for city management, policy creation, and social media simulation.
        Implement visual feedback for LLM-generated events (like memes or news articles).


Checklist for Each Task:

    Policy Generator:
        Connect to LLM service.
        Define input structure for policy ideas.
        Implement response parsing and display.


Step 4: Build and Iterate
Action Plan:

    Week 1-4: 
        Research and setup LLM integration, choose game engine, basic UI/UX design.
    Week 5-8: 
        Implement core gameplay mechanics (city management, basic policy effects).
        Start with one district's challenges.
    Week 9-12: 
        Integrate LLM for dynamic events and character interactions.
        Test the MVP, gather feedback.


Iteration:

    Regular playtesting sessions, possibly with a small community to get insights on LLM effectiveness and game balance.
    Use feedback to refine mechanics and expand LLM usage for more depth.


Step 5: Release and Update
Release Strategy:

    MVP Release: Launch on itch.io or a similar platform for indie games, gather feedback.
    Marketing: Use social media, perhaps with a teaser campaign showing LLM-generated content.


Post-Release:

    Updates: Based on player feedback, add new districts, LLM-driven events, and community features.
    Community Engagement: Host events where players suggest new content, which can be integrated through LLM.


By following this structured approach, you'll ensure that "Mayor of San Franschizo" not only gets built but does so in a way that leverages the unique capabilities of LLMs, aiming for virality and addictiveness through innovative gameplay and social interaction. Remember, the key to success is in the iteration and responsiveness to player feedback.
